Postmortem: Website Downtime Incident on June 1, 2024

Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start Time: June 1, 2024, 12:00 PM (PDT)
End Time: June 1, 2024, 2:30 PM (PDT)
Impact:
Our primary e-commerce website was as accessible as a secret government bunker, leaving 75% of users frantically refreshing their browsers and us experiencing a significant drop in sales.
Root Cause:
An automated backup system gone rogue, performing write operations with the enthusiasm of a toddler with a crayon, led to our database server waving the white flag.

Detailed Analysis
Timeline
Detection:
When: 12:05 PM PDT
How: Monitoring alerts shouting "THE DATABASE IS ON FIRE!"
Initial Actions:
Rushed to investigate the database load, like firefighters to a four-alarm blaze, suspecting heavy traffic or a possible DDoS attack.
Misleading Path: Our initial thought: "It's gotta be those pesky hackers again!" (Spoiler: it wasn't).
Escalation: Called in the Database Team, our seasoned database whisperers.
Resolution:
Halted the runaway backup process and restarted the database server (a classic "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" moment).
Kept a close eye on the database like a hawk until it behaved normally again.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
Our automated backup script, intended to save our data, decided peak hours were perfect for a full workout, causing excessive write operations that overwhelmed and crashed the database server.
Resolution:
Stopped the backup process (picture us pulling the plug on a very noisy machine).
Reconfigured the backup to run during off-peak hours with throttling to manage load, ensuring no more database tantrums.
Enhanced monitoring to detect high write operations, preventing future overloads.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Areas for Improvement
Backup Scheduling: Like having breakfast for dinner, ensure backups are done at the right time—off-peak hours.
Load Management: Introduce throttling in backup scripts to prevent them from binge-writing.
Monitoring and Alerts: Enhance our alerts to be more like a well-timed alarm clock, not a blaring siren.
Process Documentation: Update our playbook so everyone knows the new rules of the game.

Conclusion
The June 1, 2024, outage was a wake-up call, reminding us that even well-intentioned scripts can wreak havoc if not properly managed.
